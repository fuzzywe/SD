Here’s a summary of the video transcript on **"What is Fault Tolerance, and How to Build Fault-Tolerant Systems"** in 5 bullet points:

1. **Definition of Fault Tolerance**: Fault tolerance refers to a system's ability to continue functioning despite errors, failures, or outages. It's crucial in cloud computing, where maintaining uptime and reliability is essential. A fault-tolerant system ensures that services or applications can handle failures without service disruption.

2. **Examples of Fault Tolerance in Systems**: Fault tolerance can be achieved through various methods such as running multiple instances of hardware or software, using technologies like Kubernetes to ensure redundancy, and implementing backup power sources. The more robust the fault-tolerant setup, the higher the availability and reliability of the system.

3. **High Availability vs Fault Tolerance**: High availability refers to a system’s uptime and accessibility, while fault tolerance focuses on a system’s ability to recover from failures without disrupting service. Though they are often linked, achieving fault tolerance does not automatically guarantee high availability if maintenance activities disrupt the system.

4. **Graceful Degradation vs Normal Functioning**: When building fault-tolerant systems, designers can choose between maintaining full functionality under any circumstances (normal functioning) or allowing for some degradation in performance or features during an outage (graceful degradation). The choice depends on the criticality of the application and its user base.

5. **Cost Considerations in Fault Tolerant Design**: Building fault-tolerant systems involves trade-offs, as implementing multiple layers of redundancy (like multiple data centers or cloud regions) can be expensive. However, the cost of potential downtime—both in lost revenue and reputation damage—may far exceed the cost of maintaining fault tolerance.
